/*Question 2: Dynamic Memory Allocation in Traffic Light Simulation
You are building a simple traffic light system where each intersection has three lights (red, yellow, green) stored as an integer representing their status: `0` for off, `1` for on.
Write a function int* initializeTrafficLight() that:
1. Dynamically allocates an array of three integers.
2. Initializes the first element to `1` (red light on) and the other two to `0` (yellow and green lights off).
3. Returns a pointer to the array.
 
After initializing, write a second function `void changeLight(int* light, int newState)` to:
1. Accept the `light` array and `newState` (position of the new light to turn on, where `0`=red, `1`=yellow, `2`=green).
2. Update the light states so only the `newState` position is on.
 
Function Signatures:
int* initializeTrafficLight();
void changeLight(int* light, int newState);

Test Cases
1. Test Case 1  
   - Input: Initialize lights, then call `changeLight` with `newState = 2`
   - Expected Output: After `initializeTrafficLight`, `{1, 0, 0}`; After `changeLight`, `{0, 0, 1}` (green light on)
2. Test Case 2
   - Input: Initialize lights, then call `changeLight` with `newState = 1`
   - Expected Output: After `initializeTrafficLight`, `{1, 0, 0}`; After `changeLight`, `{0, 1, 0}` (yellow light on)
3. Test Case 3
   - **Input**: Initialize lights, then call `changeLight` with `newState = 0`
   - **Expected Output**: After `initializeTrafficLight`, `{1, 0, 0}`; After `changeLight`, `{1, 0, 0}` (red light remains on)
